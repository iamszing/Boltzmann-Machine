# Boltzmann-Machine
My first implementation of Boltzmann Machine.

You can download the dataset from the following link:

https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

Here you can choose various datasets and then just change the name and location in the program. 
Just make sure that the datasets and the program file are in the same working directory.
